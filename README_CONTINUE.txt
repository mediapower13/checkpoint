Progress:
- Created checkpoint folder and added many question .md and .go files.
- Set .go files to package main when they are programs or functions for standalone testing.

Next steps:
- Finish any remaining exercises not yet added.
- Run 'go vet' or 'go build' if desired to validate files. Note: many files have 'main' packages and multiple main files can coexist but they are not intended to build together; they are examples.

If you'd like, I can:
- Convert function files back to 'package piscine' and provide a single tested package.
- Run quick builds or create unit tests.
- Rename files or group by type.
